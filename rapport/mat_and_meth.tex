In this part, will be detailed all the hardware, software and methods used to carry out simulations. 

\section{Hardware and Software}

    As this internship is 100\% digital, a good comuter is required. A personal computer (MacBook Air M1) as well as a computer provided by the laboratory (under Ubuntu) will be the main equipment for this internship. \medskip

    The main softwares are the following ones:

    \begin{enumerate}[\hspace{3em}$\bullet$]
        \item \textbf{Visual Studio Code (VS Code)}: a source-code editor developed by Microsoft.
        \item \textbf{Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS)}: a molecular dynamics programm (coded in \verb|C++|) from \href{http://www.sandia.gov}{Sandia National Laboratories}.
        \item \textbf{Perseus Gricad}: high performance computing and storage platforms.  
        \item \textbf{Ovito}: a visualization and analysis software for output data generated in molecular dynamics. 
    \end{enumerate}
